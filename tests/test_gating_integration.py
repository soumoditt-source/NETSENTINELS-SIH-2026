"""Integration tests for the DDoS and C2 detector gating logic.

Run with:  pytest test_gating_integration.py -v

Why this file exists
--------------------
The earlier test harness bypassed the model wrappers, so the fire/no-fire
gating in `DDoSDetector.predict()` and `C2BeaconDetector.predict()` was never
actually exercised. These tests call predict() end-to-end.

Two tiers:
  * Deterministic tests need no model and no network. They validate the
    DDoS degenerate-flow guard and the C2 periodicity-feature discrimination.
  * Real-flow tests load fixtures from ./fixtures/ and skip (with a clear
    message) if the fixtures or the auto-downloaded ONNX models are missing.
    These are the ones that confirm the SYN-flood true positive (#2) and a
    real beacon (#3) on YOUR captures.

KNOWN LIMITATION (see test_constant_interval_beacon_is_degenerate):
  The C2 FFT features are computed on `iats - mean(iats)`. A perfectly
  periodic beacon (constant interval) becomes an all-zero signal, so the
  periodicity gate returns benign. The gate only helps for jittered/varying
  beacons. A low-jitter beacon needs the model retrained with proper negatives
  rather than a feature-threshold gate. Do not treat this gate as complete.
